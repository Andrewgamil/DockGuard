Project Objective: 
To build, containerize, and monitor a functional URL shortener webservice. The entire stack, including the application and its monitoring tools (Prometheus, Grafana), will run locally using Docker. 
Project Description: 
This project involves creating a webservice that shortens URLs, stores the mapping, and handles redirects. You will then instrument this service to expose custom performance metrics. Finally, you will use Prometheus to collect these metrics and Grafana to build a comprehensive dashboard for visualizing the service's health and usage patterns. 
Technologies to use: 
Docker, Docker Compose, Prometheus, Grafana, a web framework (e.g., Python's Flask or Node.js's Express), and a simple database like SQLite.
